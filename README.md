# NO CHEATING!!!

A collection of the Rust code I have submitted as solutions to problems on
[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com).  You may look at this code if you want
to compare with your solutions or if you've tried your darnedest and you're
stuck, but **NO CHEATING!!!**

Also, note that I am learning, so although I am trying, I may not have
necessarily followed best practices.
